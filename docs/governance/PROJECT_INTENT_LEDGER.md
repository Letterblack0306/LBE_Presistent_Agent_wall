# Project Intent Ledger

Status: **CANONICAL PRE-MUTATION INTENT LEDGER**

Every meaningful repository mutation must resolve to exactly one intent record before staging.
The machine gate binds the active slice to the `INTENT_ID`, and the affected structure must exist
in `PROJECT_INDEX.md`.

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-WORKSPACE-HYGIENE-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-WORKSPACE-HYGIENE-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Govern workspace document hygiene and bounded disposable deletion.
WHY: Prevent unexplained, stale, duplicate, generated, or abandoned workspace material from being treated as current project authority.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: docs/, scripts/, .lbe/, .agent/, lbe_guard_inspector/, tests/, unused-in-repo/
EXISTING_OWNER: LBE governance, documentation, runtime orchestration, and validation owners.
DESIRED_RESULT: Every material document has an owner, intent, reachability classification, and safe disposition; disposable deletion is governed and receipt-backed.
NON_GOALS: No new execution system, no unrestricted deletion, no destruction of unknown user work, no publication, no provider/UI architecture change.
REUSE_DECISION: Reuse existing machine gate, tool orchestrator, receipt, evidence, and documentation owners.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: Strengthens pre-mutation checks without creating a second authority owner.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: PROJECT_INDEX.md,docs/,scripts/check-implementation-gate.py,.lbe/governance/,.agent/,lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,unused-in-repo/

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-MANDATORY-GOVERNED-MUTATION-DISPATCH-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-MANDATORY-GOVERNED-MUTATION-DISPATCH-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Make LBE governed dispatch mandatory for the existing agent coding mutation path, covering bounded workspace text mutation, registered process execution, and main-only Git mutation while keeping arbitrary native mutation tools unavailable.
WHY: The LBE product requires providers to reason and request capabilities while LBE alone owns authorization, execution, receipts, and evidence. Direct filesystem, shell, or Git mutation exposure would bypass the product wall.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/, tests/, docs/acceptance/, docs/governance/, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, .lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: R6C authorization resolver; R6E GovernedToolOrchestrator, ToolRegistry, ToolRequest, and ToolReceipt; GovernedProviderReasoningController; existing workspace/session identity; provider continuation; validation/completion owners.
DESIRED_RESULT: Provider-facing coding turns receive only LBE-generated tool definitions; bounded workspace mutation and Git mutation execute through existing R6C/R6E owners with receipts; arbitrary shell/native mutation remains unavailable; registered process commands are explicit and bounded.
NON_GOALS: No second executor, no second authorization owner, no second receipt/session/completion owner, no unrestricted shell, no branch/worktree creation, no push/publication, no TUI redesign, no lbe-core mutation, no direct Cline authority.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE GovernedProviderReasoningController, R6C authorization, R6E orchestration/receipts, agent guidance, workspace governance helpers, provider continuation, and current session identity. ADAPT only tool specifications/handlers and provider registration. REJECT native filesystem/shell/Git exposure.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: LBE authority remains unchanged; the agent-facing capability surface becomes stricter and more useful.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: PROJECT_INDEX.md,lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md,docs/DOCUMENT_INTENT_MANIFEST.md,.lbe/governance/

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-GOVERNED-EXTERNAL-CAPABILITY-REGISTRATION-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-GOVERNED-EXTERNAL-CAPABILITY-REGISTRATION-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Add one LBE-owned registration contract for MCP, plugin, subagent, network, and hosted-service capabilities so integrations can be exposed to providers only through existing ToolRegistry/R6C/R6E dispatch.
WHY: Current source has no runtime MCP/plugin/subagent owner and no generic agent-facing network/hosted-service owner. External integrations must become registered governed capabilities rather than direct provider tools or parallel executors.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/, tests/, docs/acceptance/, docs/governance/, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, .lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: ToolRegistry; GovernedToolOrchestrator; R6C authorization resolver; ToolRequest/ToolReceipt; GovernedProviderReasoningController; provider continuation; canonical session/workspace/completion owners. Existing provider HTTP and local callback transports remain transport-specific and are not promoted into generic external authority.
DESIRED_RESULT: Preconfigured external adapters are classified by kind, registered as ToolSpec/ToolHandler pairs, projected to the provider only through LBE-generated tool definitions, authorized before execution, and returned as correlated ToolReceipt evidence. Agent-controlled endpoint/executable/shell transport selection is rejected.
NON_GOALS: No generic arbitrary HTTP client, no raw endpoint tool, no shell transport, no second executor, no second authorization/receipt/session/completion owner, no direct MCP/plugin/subagent authority, no publication, no TUI redesign.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE ToolRegistry, ToolSpec, ToolExecutionContext, R6C, R6E, provider tool projection and receipt continuation. ADD only the missing external capability registration metadata/validation layer and optional controller injection seam.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: No new execution authority; this constrains future external integrations to the existing LBE execution wall.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/,tests/,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md,.lbe/governance/
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: five external kinds classified, pre-registration required, raw transport arguments denied, network metadata enforced, provider-only LBE projection, authorization-before-adapter execution, correlated receipts, unregistered fail-closed, no duplicate authority owner

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-FIRST-RUN-LIVE-SESSION-ENTRY-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-FIRST-RUN-LIVE-SESSION-ENTRY-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Provide one product-level first-run/live-session entry path that creates or restores a persisted LBE session using the existing workspace, provider/profile, policy, session, provider-turn, and terminal owners.
WHY: The runtime pieces are proven individually, but users should enter the LBE product through one bounded start path instead of manually composing session creation/restoration and terminal entry.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/cli.py, lbe_guard_inspector/session_memory_runtime.py, lbe_guard_inspector/textual_tui.py, tests/, docs/acceptance/, docs/governance/, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, .lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: CLI thin control plane; SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge and WorkspaceMemoryStore persisted session owners; provider registry/profile/config/health owners; BackgroundProviderTurnRuntime and GovernedAgentGateway; Textual LBE projection/control client.
DESIRED_RESULT: `lbe start` deterministically restores an existing session or creates one new persisted session from explicit workspace/mode/provider/model/profile inputs, validates provider identity/config where execution is requested, then enters the existing live TUI/runtime without introducing a second session or provider authority.
NON_GOALS: No new session database, no new credential store, no new provider registry, no provider fallback, no direct external execution bypass, no TUI redesign, no publication, no lbe-core/lbe-tui mutation.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE `_session_create`, `_runtime_from_state`, WorkspaceMemoryStore, SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge, existing provider validation/configuration, `_tui`, provider turn runtimes, PersistentTurnControl, and Textual projection. ADD only a product-level start resolver/CLI surface and focused acceptance tests.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: No authority expansion; this composes existing owners into one entry path.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md,.lbe/governance/
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: create-new persisted session, restore-existing persisted session, explicit provider/model consistency, provider-config mismatch denial, no silent provider fallback, stable session identity, existing TUI/runtime owner reuse, no duplicate session/provider authority, full regression

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-INSTALLED-CAPABILITY-REGISTRY-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-INSTALLED-CAPABILITY-REGISTRY-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Add one persisted, LBE-owned installed capability registry that discovers and configures concrete MCP/plugin/service/subagent adapters, then converts only validated configured entries into the already-proven governed external-capability registration contract.
WHY: The generic external registration contract is proven, but the product still lacks a concrete installed/configured integration inventory. Users need LBE to know which integrations exist and which governed capabilities are actually available without exposing raw transport configuration to the reasoning provider.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/, lbe_guard_inspector/cli.py, lbe_guard_inspector/textual_tui.py, tests/, docs/acceptance/, docs/governance/, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, .lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: ExternalCapabilityRegistration/register_external_capabilities; ToolRegistry/R6C/R6E; CLI thin control plane; persisted workspace/session owners; terminal capability projection. No separate integration executor or provider-owned transport authority may be created.
DESIRED_RESULT: LBE can list configured installed integrations, validate their kind/tool identity and configuration provenance, report unavailable/misconfigured entries, and materialize only safe preconfigured adapters into the existing governed registry. The provider sees capability schemas, never raw endpoint/executable/shell credentials or transport-selection authority.
NON_GOALS: No arbitrary MCP auto-execution from filesystem discovery, no generic HTTP client, no shell command registry supplied by the model, no credential plaintext persistence, no direct plugin/subagent authority, no publication, no lbe-core/lbe-tui mutation.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE external_capabilities.py, ToolRegistry/R6C/R6E, existing configuration/persistence/terminal projection owners. ADD only installed-integration metadata, validation/discovery/config loading, bounded adapter factories, and product/CLI projection.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: No new execution authority. This turns concrete installed integrations into governed registrations under existing LBE policy.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md,.lbe/governance/
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: persisted installed-registry schema, five-kind configuration classification, invalid/duplicate configuration denial, no plaintext credential persistence, unavailable integration projection, safe conversion to ExternalCapabilityRegistration, provider transport arguments remain hidden, existing R6C/R6E path reused, focused tests, full regression

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-INTERFACE-CONTROL-EVIDENCE-SURFACES-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-INTERFACE-CONTROL-EVIDENCE-SURFACES-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Complete the remaining LBE-owned terminal projection and control surfaces by connecting installed integration/MCP state to the existing Textual client and proving settings, provider, session, evidence, receipt/diff detail, interrupt, and cancel surfaces remain backed by existing runtime owners.
WHY: The LBE interface already owns keyboard-first session/provider/evidence/control projection, but `/integrations` and `/mcp` remained hard-coded unavailable placeholders even though the installed capability registry is now proven. Product truth must be projected without creating new execution authority.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/textual_tui.py, lbe_guard_inspector/tui_view_models.py, lbe_guard_inspector/terminal_projection.py, lbe_guard_inspector/product_entry.py, lbe_guard_inspector/cli.py, tests/, docs/acceptance/, docs/governance/, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, .lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: Textual LBE client; terminal projection; TUI view models; SessionOperationalHistory; PersistentTurnControl; persisted session/provider/settings owners; installed capability registry and existing ToolRegistry projection seam.
DESIRED_RESULT: The live LBE interface truthfully shows installed integration/MCP availability from LBE-owned registry data, keeps settings/provider/session/evidence/diff/control projections owner-backed, and never authorizes or executes integrations merely by displaying them.
NON_GOALS: No UI redesign, no new terminal framework, no new integration executor, no direct TUI filesystem/network/service execution, no second session/provider/authorization/receipt/completion owner, no publication, no lbe-core/lbe-tui mutation.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE build_textual_tui/run_textual_tui, ToolRegistry projection seam, installed capability registry metadata, terminal event/detail projections, SessionOperationalHistory, PersistentTurnControl, provider and session owners. ADAPT only bounded projection inputs and truthful rendering/tests.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: No authority expansion. The interface remains projection/control only.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md,.lbe/governance/
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: installed registry projects without execution, integrations command truthfully lists installed state, MCP command filters MCP state, settings/provider remain read-only or owner-delegated, session switching/new session reuse persistence owner, receipt/evidence/diff detail identity preserved, interrupt/cancel route through PersistentTurnControl, no duplicate authority owner, focused TUI regression, full regression

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-RECOVERY-COMPLETION-PROMOTION-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-RECOVERY-COMPLETION-PROMOTION-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Complete the normal governed coding lifecycle by composing existing R5 bounded recovery, trusted completion-evidence producers, R6F deterministic completion, and validated memory promotion so provider completion remains provisional until LBE proof is ready.
WHY: The normal coding gateway already establishes an immutable completion contract and produces trusted source_change/focused_test/git_status evidence, but it stops before calling the existing completion gate. Recovery and completion are proven separately; the product still needs one owner-composed lifecycle that automatically finalizes deterministic proof and promotes only validated completion truth.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/agent_integration.py, lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/completion_runtime.py, lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/completion_evidence_producers.py, lbe_guard_inspector/session_memory_runtime.py, lbe_guard_inspector/memory/, tests/, docs/acceptance/, docs/governance/, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, .lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge.run_recoverable/load_recovery_state; lbe_guard_inspector/recovery.py; CodingCompletionRuntime and existing completion gate; CompletionEvidenceProducers; TaskCompletionEvidencePersistence; MemoryPromoter/WorkspaceMemoryStore; GovernedAgentGateway.
DESIRED_RESULT: Mutation-capable reasoning is executed once without automatic retry; trusted idempotent validation/evidence operations may use bounded persisted recovery; provider COMPLETED creates only provisional/unverified task-completion proof; the normal gateway calls the existing deterministic completion gate after trusted evidence exists; READY sets the task COMPLETED and promotes the same task-completion proof to VERIFIED; FAILED/INCOMPLETE never creates verified completion truth.
NON_GOALS: No retry of mutation-capable provider reasoning, no second recovery engine, no second completion evaluator, no provider-selected evidence, no direct promotion of provider prose, no new memory database, no publication, no lbe-core/lbe-tui mutation.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE R5 recovery through SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge, existing R6F completion runtime/evaluator, C2 evidence producers, MemoryPromoter, task/session persistence and GovernedAgentGateway. ADD only the missing lifecycle composition and provisional-to-verified completion proof contract.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: No new authority owner. LBE completion truth becomes automatic on the normal path while remaining evidence-gated.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: PROJECT_INDEX.md,lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md,docs/DOCUMENT_INTENT_MANIFEST.md,.lbe/governance/
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: provider completion provisional before gate, provisional task_complete memory unverified, mutation reasoning not retried, idempotent validation recovery only, recovery state persists across runtime reconstruction, trusted evidence loaded from existing persistence, existing completion gate invoked automatically, READY alone promotes task_complete VERIFIED, failed/incomplete cannot promote verified completion, terminal recovery state prevents duplicate validation operation execution, no duplicate authority owner, focused integration tests, full regression

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-INSTALLED-PACKAGE-END-TO-END-ACCEPTANCE-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-INSTALLED-PACKAGE-END-TO-END-ACCEPTANCE-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Prove the complete LBE runtime from an isolated installed distribution, not from repository-source imports, exercising the normal product entry, persisted session/provider path, governed capability dispatch, evidence, recovery, and deterministic completion.
WHY: All complete-runtime source slices are proven; the remaining product requirement is proof that the packaged and installed artifact composes those owners correctly as the product.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,scripts/,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md,.lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: product_entry and CLI entry point; SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge/WorkspaceMemoryStore; provider registry/config/health; GovernedAgentGateway; R6C authorization; R6E GovernedToolOrchestrator/ToolRegistry/ToolReceipt; CompletionEvidenceProducers; CodingCompletionRuntime; R5 recovery; MemoryPromoter; Textual LBE interface.
DESIRED_RESULT: A freshly built isolated installed LBE distribution can create/restore a session, use an explicitly configured provider, execute governed capabilities only through LBE, produce correlated evidence and receipts, deterministically validate completion, and survive runtime reconstruction without importing canonical runtime code from the source tree.
NON_GOALS: No TUI redesign, no session-lifecycle-unification patch, no Cline integration, no lbe-tui activation, no lbe-core mutation, no release/tag/publication, no version change unless an already-proven packaging defect blocks the installed proof.
REUSE_DECISION: ACCEPTANCE ONLY. Reuse all existing LBE runtime, provider, session, authorization, dispatch, receipt, evidence, recovery, completion, promotion, and Textual owners; add no authority.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: NONE. Acceptance only; no new runtime/provider/session/execution/completion authority.

STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Unify CLI and Textual session/provider lifecycle operations behind one shared LbeSessionService contract while preserving existing LBE persistence, provider, and turn-control owners.
WHY: The preserved lifecycle patch removes duplicate CLI/TUI lifecycle call sites, but it must be reconciled against current main and activated under its own architecture intent before it can be used.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/session_lifecycle.py,lbe_guard_inspector/cli.py,lbe_guard_inspector/textual_tui.py,tests/test_session_lifecycle.py,tests/test_cli.py,tests/test_textual_tui.py,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md,.lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge / WorkspaceMemoryStore; ProviderRegistry; PersistentTurnControl; existing CLI and Textual projection owners. No second session, provider, persistence, or turn-control authority may be created.
DESIRED_RESULT: CLI and Textual session creation, resume, and provider selection call one shared LbeSessionService while persisted identity, provider/model state, event projection, and turn control remain owned by existing runtime services.
NON_GOALS: No TUI redesign; no lbe-tui activation; no lbe-core mutation; no provider transport replacement; no new persistence or authorization system; no publication or release.
REUSE_DECISION: ADAPT the preserved lifecycle patch only after hash verification and reconcile it against current main; preserve SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge, WorkspaceMemoryStore, ProviderRegistry, PersistentTurnControl, and existing CLI/Textual owners.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: One shared application-service contract; no new persistence, provider, execution, authorization, receipt, or completion authority.

DESIRED_RESULT: Cline mechanics are adapted behind LBE authority; native Cline mutation/execution is
not canonical.
NON_GOALS: No direct Cline mutation authority, no second session authority, no React runtime before
the adapter boundary is proven.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE continuation/event/tool mechanics; ADAPT provider and presentation mechanics;

STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Deliver the usable LBE interface on the existing canonical Textual owner, with the supplied visual direction and selectively adapted interaction mechanics behind LBE authority.
WHY: The product identity is LBE and the interface must expose the real persisted session, provider, capability, receipt, evidence, and control state in a usable terminal surface.

EXISTING_OWNER: Textual LBE interface; SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge; WorkspaceMemoryStore; ProviderRegistry; PersistentTurnControl; ToolRegistry; ToolReceipt; persisted evidence and completion owners.
DESIRED_RESULT: A runnable LBE interface provides a clear conversation surface, persisted session/provider state, capability visibility, streaming/runtime feedback, receipt/evidence detail, and keyboard controls without acquiring execution or authorization authority.
NON_GOALS: No lbe-tui activation; no independent provider transport; no independent session identity; no native shell execution; no second runtime, persistence, authorization, receipt, evidence, or completion owner; no publication; no branch or worktree creation.
REUSE_DECISION: ADAPT approved interaction, continuation, event, streaming, layout, and branding mechanics from reference inputs only; preserve LBE runtime and authority owners.

REQUEST: Deliver progressive provider conversation feedback in the LBE interface using the existing LBE provider adapter, persisted event history, background turn runtime, and Textual projection.
WHY: The LBE product must show live model feedback while preserving LBE ownership of provider selection, session identity, authorization, execution, receipts, evidence, persistence, and completion.
EXISTING_OWNER: OpenAI-compatible provider adapter; provider turn runtime; PersistentTurnControl; SessionOperationalHistory; Textual LBE interface.
DESIRED_RESULT: Provider message deltas are normalized and persisted as they arrive, the LBE interface projects them during a running turn, and terminal completion remains authoritative and deterministic.

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-CLINE-SURFACE-DIRECTION-001 (AMENDED: HTML-BASED LBE TUI)

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-CLINE-SURFACE-DIRECTION-001
STATUS: ACCEPTED (explicit user product decision, recorded 2026-08-26)
REQUEST: Record the product owner's binding technology decision for the LBE interface surface:
         the Cline CLI/SDK (https://cline.bot/cli, https://docs.cline.bot/sdk/overview) is the
         approved implementation surface direction; the Python/Textual LBE interface is REJECTED
         as the final LBE product UI technology.
WHY: The product owner directed reuse of mature, already-served Cline CLI/SDK capabilities
     instead of re-implementing them. Continuation of the pre-existing Python/Textual interface
     was an agent interpretation, never an approved final technology decision.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: docs/governance/, docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md, docs/research/, future lbe_guard_inspector/ presentation surfaces
EXISTING_OWNER: Product owner decision authority; LBE runtime/control/event contracts (unchanged).
DESIRED_RESULT: Future interface/product work targets Cline CLI/SDK mechanics under LBE
                authority (REUSE runtime interaction/continuation mechanics; ADAPT provider and
                presentation mechanics); no further Python/Textual product-surface investment.
NON_GOALS: No retroactive rewriting or deletion of completed checkpoint records; no second
           execution/authorization/session/persistence/completion authority; no immediate code
           deletion in this record; migration scoping happens in a follow-up slice.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE Cline AgentRuntime/CLI/SDK mature mechanics; ADAPT onto LBE-owned
                governance, authorization, receipts, evidence, persistence, and completion;
                REJECT continued Python/Textual development as the product UI platform.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: Presentation-platform ownership changes direction. LBE remains sole runtime,
                  authorization, receipt, evidence, session, and completion authority.

WHY: The stdio bridge proved worker mechanics in isolation; product turns require one runtime
     owner persisting worker events through SessionOperationalHistory while completion,
     authorization, receipts, and evidence remain LBE-owned.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/cline_provider_turn_runtime.py, tests/, docs/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: GovernedClineWorker; GovernedToolOrchestrator/R6C/R6E; SessionOperationalHistory;
                PersistentTurnControl-compatible turn lifecycle; turn finalization owners.
DESIRED_RESULT: ClineWorkerTurnRuntime satisfies the same foreground runtime contract as the
                existing non-streaming owner (run/cancel/was_cancelled/supports_cancellation),
                persists model message/turn events, fails closed on worker errors, and records
                no completion truth for cancelled turns.
NON_GOALS: No UI work (owned by parallel UI-experience slice); no second execution,
           authorization, receipt, session, persistence, or completion authority; no CLI entry
           rewiring in this record; no publication.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE GovernedClineWorker protocol/lifecycle, GovernedToolOrchestrator tool
                mediation, SessionOperationalHistory event/finalization owners.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: None. Cline remains mechanics under LBE authority.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/,tests/,docs/governance/
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: completed turn persists message + finalizes COMPLETED; failed turn persists

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-CLINE-NATIVE-SURFACE-INTEGRATION-001
STATUS: ACCEPTED (explicit user implementation direction, recorded 2026-08-27)
REQUEST: Integrate the native Cline CLI/OpenTUI source as the LBE terminal surface while
         replacing visible product identity with LetterBlack Execution Engine and routing
         all authority-bearing runtime callbacks through existing LBE owners.
WHY: Cline CLI/OpenTUI is the selected base implementation and interaction model. LBE must
     reuse its native terminal mechanics without exposing Cline as the visible product or
     inheriting Cline's independent permission, execution, persistence, receipt, evidence,
     or completion authority.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: vendor/cline-cli/, lbe_guard_inspector/, tests/, .github/workflows/,
                    docs/acceptance/, docs/governance/, PROJECT_INDEX.md
EXISTING_OWNER: Pinned Cline CLI/OpenTUI source for rendering and interaction mechanics;
                LBE session, provider, authorization, ToolRegistry, GovernedToolOrchestrator,
                ToolReceipt, evidence, persistence, cancellation, and completion owners.
DESIRED_RESULT: Native Cline OpenTUI launches as LetterBlack Execution Engine, preserves
                Cline terminal interaction mechanics, exposes LBE terminology and authority
                events, and cannot execute an authority-bearing tool outside the LBE boundary.
NON_GOALS: No separate Python/Textual UI, no HTML runtime surface, no native Cline mutation
           authority, no second session/provider/persistence/authorization/receipt/evidence/
           completion owner, no branch, no worktree, no publication, no global installation
           mutation, and no unpinned dependency drift.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE pinned Cline CLI/OpenTUI rendering, input, dialog, streaming, and
                session interaction mechanics; ADAPT the runtime callback bridge and visible
                terminology to LBE; REJECT native Cline authority-bearing tool execution.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: LBE remains sole authority for permissions, governed execution, receipts,
                  evidence, persistence, cancellation, and completion truth.
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: pinned upstream source identity; native OpenTUI local launch; exact visible
                   branding audit; LBE authority callback tests; denied/allowed tool receipt
                   tests; session restore; streaming; cancellation; package/build proof;
                   full Python regression; native CLI tests; main-only topology proof.

STATUS: ACTIVE
REQUEST: Activate the bounded TUI P2/P3 governed-execution integration slice through the existing LBE R6C/R6E authorization, ToolRegistry, GovernedToolOrchestrator, ToolReceipt, evidence, validation, and completion owners.
WHY: P1 read-only attachment is complete. The TUI now requires an explicitly scoped integration slice to submit authority-bearing requests without creating a second executor, authorization owner, receipt owner, evidence owner, or completion owner.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: PROJECT_INDEX.md,docs/governance/PROJECT_INTENT_LEDGER.md,.lbe/governance/implementation-gates.json,lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,docs/acceptance/
EXISTING_OWNER: Existing LBE R6C authorization resolver; R6E ToolRegistry, GovernedToolOrchestrator, ToolRequest, and ToolReceipt; existing workspace/session identity; evidence, validation, and completion owners; canonical TUI LbeWrapper adapter.
DESIRED_RESULT: The TUI integration may adapt request and projection contracts to the existing governed LBE execution path while all authorization, policy, execution, evidence, validation, receipt, and completion truth remains LBE-owned.
NON_GOALS: No second executor; no second authorization, receipt, evidence, validation, persistence, or completion owner; no unrestricted shell; no direct Cline authority; no provider generation; no branch/worktree creation; no publication; no UI redesign; no bypass of Agent Wall policy.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE existing R6C/R6E authorization and orchestration owners, ToolRegistry, ToolReceipt, evidence/validation/completion services, session/workspace identity, and the canonical TUI LbeWrapper boundary. ADAPT only TUI request/event/snapshot wiring.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: No new authority owner. This slice opens only the bounded adapter path to already-proven Agent Wall governed execution.
EXPECTED_PATH_PREFIXES: PROJECT_INDEX.md,docs/governance/, .lbe/governance/,lbe_guard_inspector/,tests/,docs/acceptance/
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: active intent and matching machine slice; current PROJECT_INDEX revision binding; authorization-before-execution; provider receives only LBE-generated tool definitions; governed ToolReceipt correlation; mutation denial outside registered capabilities; read-only audit/investigation preservation; focused tests; full regression; no duplicate authority owner.

## Product-owner correction — HTML-based TUI

The prior Cline surface-direction record is amended by the current product decision: the
supplied `docs/reference/ui/lbe_runtime_console.html` and
`docs/reference/ui/lbe_runtime_surface_preview.html` are the visual/layout basis for the LBE
TUI. Cline is reference material for interaction ideas only. A copied Cline CLI/OpenTUI tree is
not a product UI implementation and must remain quarantined as reference/archive material.
The existing LBE Textual projection and all existing LBE runtime/authority owners remain the
canonical implementation boundary.

## INTENT LBE-INTENT-LBE-HOME-PROVIDER-CONTRACT-VERIFICATION-001

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-LBE-HOME-PROVIDER-CONTRACT-VERIFICATION-001
STATUS: COMPLETED
REQUEST: Verify the contract and ownership boundary for the LBE Home/provider experience before
         implementing or staging the HTML product surface.
WHY: The supplied HTML establishes the intended LBE landing and provider/model setup experience,
     but its model discovery is currently a reference simulation and no runtime bridge has been
     proven. Existing LBE owners must be mapped before any UI or provider integration changes.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: .ui-preview/,docs/reference/ui/,docs/contracts/LBE_HOME_PROVIDER_SURFACE_CONTRACT.md,
                    lbe_guard_inspector/provider_registry.py,

                    .lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: LBE provider registry and descriptors; provider/model capability-discovery contract;
                provider health contract; LbeSessionService and persisted SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge/
                WorkspaceMemoryStore owners; existing HTML/CSS/JavaScript projection boundary; LBE
                authorization, execution, receipt, evidence, persistence, validation, and completion
                owners. Cline/OpenTUI and unused-in-repo material are reference-only.
DESIRED_RESULT: A read-only contract verification identifies the authoritative provider/model discovery,
                health, session, and projection seams; distinguishes static/reference behavior from
                live behavior; records every implementation gap; and proves that the future Home/
                provider surface remains a projection/control client under LBE authority.
NON_GOALS: No implementation; no staging or cleanup of existing dirty paths; no provider I/O or
           credential changes; no new provider registry, session, transport, authorization, execution,
           receipt, evidence, persistence, validation, or completion authority; no Textual product UI;
           no Cline/OpenTUI product surface; no branch/worktree/publication.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE existing ProviderRegistry, ProviderModelCapabilitySnapshot,
                discover_provider_model_capabilities, provider health, LbeSessionService,
                SessionMemoryRuntimeBridge, persisted history, and LBE projection/control contracts;
                ADAPT only after the read-only contract gaps and bridge boundary are proven.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: None. This is a read-only verification slice and does not authorize product or
                  runtime implementation.

REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: dirty-path ownership matrix; HTML static/reference versus live-runtime classification;
                   provider/model discovery and health owner mapping; session/provider persistence owner
                   mapping; LBE authority-boundary proof; obsolete Textual and quarantined Cline disposition;

```text
INTENT_ID: LBE-INTENT-LBE-HOME-PROVIDER-OWNER-NORMALIZATION-001
STATUS: PROPOSED (non-authorizing until explicitly activated by the machine gate)
REQUEST: Add bounded provider-boundary normalization for model discovery, provider-specific
         authentication results, and typed provider health outcomes before implementing the HTML
         bridge or changing the HTML surface.
WHY: The frozen Home/provider contract has proven its existing owner mappings but live model
     enumeration, authentication state, and typed health failures still have no complete producers.
     These state producers must be bounded and evidence-bearing before bridge composition.
AFFECTED_STRUCTURE: lbe_guard_inspector/provider_registry.py,
                    lbe_guard_inspector/provider_capability_discovery.py,
                    lbe_guard_inspector/provider_health.py,lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/,

                    .lbe/governance/
EXISTING_OWNER: ProviderRegistry and provider-specific adapters; ProviderModelCapabilitySnapshot;
                existing provider health probe; LBE runtime/provider boundary; existing evidence,
                session, authorization, execution, persistence, validation, and completion owners.
                No standalone global authentication service is authorized by this intent.
DESIRED_RESULT: Existing provider-boundary adapters return deterministic model-discovery results,
                provider-specific authentication outcomes normalized to unknown/authenticated/
                authentication_required/unavailable, and typed health outcomes with reasons and
                optional evidence references. Registry identity, session selection, and LBE authority
                remain owned by their existing owners.
NON_GOALS: No HTML changes; no bridge implementation; no Textual cleanup; no session/runtime
           authority changes; no replacement ProviderRegistry; no standalone global authentication
           service; no provider fallback; no credential persistence changes; no provider I/O outside
           explicitly bounded provider adapters; no receipts for ordinary reads by default; no
           publication, branch, or worktree.
REUSE_DECISION: REUSE ProviderRegistry for registered provider identity, existing provider-specific
                adapter mechanics, ProviderModelCapabilitySnapshot for configuration-derived claims,
                check_provider_health as the health owner, and existing LBE evidence/persistence/
                authority owners. ADD only bounded provider-boundary discovery/auth probes and a
                normalization layer; ADAPT health output without replacing its owner.
AUTHORITY_IMPACT: No new session, authorization, execution, receipt, evidence, persistence,
                  validation, or completion authority. Provider adapters own provider-specific
                  mechanics; LBE normalization owns only the bounded surface result.

                         docs/contracts/,docs/acceptance/,docs/governance/,PROJECT_INDEX.md,.lbe/governance/
REQUIRED_EVIDENCE: provider model enumeration is bounded and distinct from registry identity;
                   discovery collection state and provenance are deterministic; provider-specific
                   authentication outcomes are explicit and not inferred from health/errors; health
                   results are typed with deterministic reasons; optional evidence references remain
                   optional; no credential leakage or persistence change; no second provider/session/
                   authority owner; focused owner-normalization tests; full regression; diff check.
