# Stage 3 Governance Alignment Checkpoint

Status: `PASS_LOCAL`

Stage 3 reconciles the machine gate, current-status projection, human current gate, and active
acceptance gate. One live owner now defines each current authorization fact; older gates remain
historical or superseded evidence and do not compete for active authority.

## Canonical machine state

```text
active_plan: docs/acceptance/COMPLETE_LBE_AGENT_RUNTIME_GATE.md
active_phase: COMPLETE_LBE_AGENT_RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION
active_slice: DOCTRINE_TO_PROVIDER_CONTEXT_BRIDGE
status: OPEN
implementation_allowed: true (active complete-runtime slice only)
architecture_changes_allowed: true (explicit user authorization)
next_phase_locked: true
publish_allowed: false
```

## Live owners

| Fact | Owner |
|---|---|
| Permission and active slice | `.lbe/governance/implementation-gates.json` |
| Current prose projection | `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` |
| Human-readable current gate | `docs/acceptance/CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GATE.md` |
| Active acceptance evidence | `docs/acceptance/COMPLETE_LBE_AGENT_RUNTIME_GATE.md` |
| Ordered implementation plan | `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` |
| Historical or superseded gate records | their named files under `docs/acceptance/` |

## Reconciliations applied

- The machine gate selects the complete LBE agent runtime gate and doctrine-to-provider context
  bridge as the only active implementation slice.
- Current status and the human current gate project that same phase, slice, status, permissions,
  and publication lock.
- The active acceptance gate now explicitly projects the machine-selected phase and slice.
- The implementation plan no longer calls terminal-workspace foundation the active gate.
- `CURRENT_AGENT_EXECUTION_GATE.md` now identifies the complete-runtime gate as current authority
  and retains the roadmap/P16 material as historical evidence.
- `COMPLETE_LBE_TUI_IMPLEMENTATION_GATE.md` is explicitly superseded and retained as history.
- Publication preparation remains paused; no release or publication action is authorized.

## Boundary and validation

- No runtime source, tests, B2/B3 implementation path, B5 quarantine evidence, or unrelated dirty
  path was changed or staged.
- No release, tag, publication, or architecture implementation was performed.
- JSON parsing of `.lbe/governance/implementation-gates.json`: PASS.
- Machine/human/active-gate phase, slice, and status comparison: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, with only existing LF→CRLF conversion warnings.

Stage 4 and later remain locked pending the next explicit stage transition and its required gate.
