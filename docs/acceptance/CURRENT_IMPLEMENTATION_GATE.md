# Current Implementation Gate

Status: **OPEN — TUI P2/P3 GOVERNED EXECUTION INTEGRATION — PUBLICATION PAUSED**

This file is the human-readable projection of `.lbe/governance/implementation-gates.json`.
The machine-declared active plan is
`docs/acceptance/COMPLETE_LBE_AGENT_RUNTIME_GATE.md`; live Git/runtime/validation
evidence and the machine gate outrank this summary.

## CURRENT MACHINE STATE (authoritative projection)

```text
active_plan: docs/acceptance/COMPLETE_LBE_AGENT_RUNTIME_GATE.md
phase: P2_P3_GOVERNED_EXECUTION
slice: TUI_P2_P3_GOVERNED_EXECUTION_INTEGRATION
status: OPEN
implementation_allowed: true — active Cline CLI LBE-backed runtime integration slice only
architecture_changes_allowed: true (explicit user authorization)
next_phase_locked: true
required_status_for_advance: PASS
publication: LOCKED / NOT AUTHORIZED
```

Only the exact paths and scope declared by the machine gate are authorized. The active slice is
the TUI P2/P3 governed-execution integration. It does not authorize a second runtime, provider,
execution, authorization, evidence, receipt, or completion owner.

### Selected reasoning-agent source

The current user-selected reasoning-agent source is the official Cline repository:
`https://github.com/cline/cline`. Cline supplies reasoning, planning, tool proposals, continuation,
and response-composition mechanics. LBE remains the authority for identity, authorization, governed
execution, receipts, evidence, persistence, validation, and completion. Cline's native mutation,
shell, MCP, session, or completion authority must not bypass the LBE adapter boundary.

The authoritative machine source is:

```text
C:\Agents-Memory-Tool-v6-integration\.lbe\governance\implementation-gates.json
```

Its active intent is `LBE-INTENT-CLINE-CLI-LBE-RUNTIME-INTEGRATION-001`, owned by the existing
LBE session/provider/authorization/ToolRegistry/GovernedToolOrchestrator/receipt/evidence/
persistence/validation/completion owners with the Cline CLI LBE-backed runtime adapter as the
projection client.

### Product surface scope — existing LetterBlack entry and runtime

The active LetterBlack product surface is the existing launcher and Python runtime entry:
`bin/lbe.js`, `run-lbe.bat`, `lbe_guard_inspector.product_entry`, and
`lbe_guard_inspector.cli`. The bundled Cline worker under
`lbe_guard_inspector/runtime/cline_worker/` supplies reusable governed reasoning mechanics.
Cline remains a client/reasoning mechanics layer, not an authority owner. LBE
runtime/authorization/execution/receipt/evidence/session/persistence/validation/completion
ownership is unchanged.

## Accepted baseline

```text
R3-R6F: PROVEN_COMPLETE
CLI: PROVEN_COMPLETE
R7_INSTALLED_END_TO_END_ACCEPTANCE: PASS
RELEASE_PACKAGE_CONTRACT_REPAIR: PASS
RELEASE_PACKAGE_READINESS_ACCEPTANCE: PASS
PUBLICATION_PRECHECK: PASS
```

## Previously completed workspace-hygiene slice

```text
focused governed deletion and mode tests: PASS — 52 passed
 -> nine approved disposable targets deleted through workspace.delete
 -> zero approved disposable targets remain outside protected exclusions
 -> fourteen historical snapshots preserved and excluded from this slice

The workspace-hygiene slice is a completed accepted baseline. It is not the current active slice;
the machine gate identifies TUI P2/P3 governed-execution integration as active.
```

`publish_allowed` remains false. Version 2.0.3 preparation is paused and must be reactivated by
a future machine-gate change after the active integration slice passes.

## Startup projection reconciliation — 2026-09-02

The normal `lbe start` path now returns the workspace profile and selected guard catalog as
read-only startup projections. It uses `ProjectProfiler` and `select_guard_catalog`; it does not
run guards or authorize, execute, receipt, persist, or complete a proposed operation. Those
responsibilities remain with the canonical LBE runtime owners.

The originating CEP reference artifacts are now represented in the canonical rule surface:
`cep.callback_contract` is part of the `cep` catalog and resolves through `rules/cep.py` to the
deterministic callback guard in `rules/cep_callback.py`. `examples/reference/` remains provenance
and schema documentation rather than runtime configuration.

This closes only the startup profile/catalog projection sub-slice. It does not change the machine
gate status above and does not prove installed TUI writable mutation, MCP/BirdEye projection,
provider continuation through the installed client, or release readiness.

## Reconciliation note — 2026-08-30

This human-readable projection was reconciled with the machine gate. Older references in this
file to `WORKSPACE_HYGIENE_GOVERNED_DELETION` remain preserved as historical slice evidence;
they are not current authorization. Current authorization is the machine-declared
`TUI_P2_P3_GOVERNED_EXECUTION_INTEGRATION` slice above.

## HISTORICAL FAILURE (preserved, not current state)

The earlier R7 observable-3 installed coding-composition failure is retained in
`docs/history/legacy-acceptance/R7_REPAIR_INVESTIGATION_GATE.md`,
`docs/history/legacy-acceptance/R7_REPAIR_IMPLEMENTATION_GATE.md`, and
`docs/acceptance/R7_INSTALLED_END_TO_END_ACCEPTANCE_GATE.md`. It does not mark current R7 as
failed: R7 is `PASS`, with observables 3 and 13 recorded `PASS_AFTER_REPAIR`.

## ARCHITECTURAL LESSON (proposed follow-on review, not an active gate)

> **LBE governs an agent's capabilities and consequences; it does not prescribe the agent's
> reasoning procedure.**

The architectural mistake was that the reasoning controller became the agent:
`LBERequestController` and the fixed `ReasoningPlan` workflow evolved from a bounded inspection
mechanism into the central cognitive path. The intended relationship is:

```text
reasoning agent
    ↓ uses
LBE governed capabilities
```

The provider owns reasoning, strategy, hypothesis formation, capability selection, replanning,
interpretation, and communication. LBE owns identity, mode/policy, authorization, capability
boundaries, governed execution, operation identity, ToolReceipt, evidence provenance,
persistence, and deterministic validation/completion truth.

Existing components must be repositioned rather than discarded: `LBERequestController` becomes a
bounded/specialist investigation capability; `ReasoningPlan` is optional for specific
planning/inspection capabilities; Guard Inspector remains deterministic; R6C/R6E/ToolReceipt
remain the authoritative execution boundary; memory/context are resources for reasoning.

This is a future architecture acceptance requirement / proposed follow-on review. It does not
activate a new machine gate or change this gate state. The complete comparison and acceptance
question are in `docs/design/AGENT_AGENCY_LBE_AUTHORITY_SEPARATION.md` and
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` section 15.

## Reuse and integration requirements — 2026-08-31

The active TUI P2/P3 integration must reuse existing LBE owners and existing external mechanics
where compatible. Cline is the accepted `ADAPT` source for provider streaming, agent-loop
continuation, tool proposal/result, and abort mechanics. OpenCode is an additional reuse source;
the pinned revision `dc4449df0d52199704ea4989a5a993ebbc605612` is classified in the TUI interop
 strategy (`C:\LBE-TUI-Lab\Docs\31_cline_interop_reuse_strategy.md`). That workspace is a
**candidate/reference** workspace, not runtime authority. No frontend is canonical until explicitly
selected through the user-authorized transition process. The recovered `lbe-authority` bridge is a
bounded integration seam pending wiring; the LBE-owned adapter and installed interactive proof remain
required for whichever frontend is selected.

Required implementation behavior:

1. use the existing LBE session, provider, policy, authorization, ToolRegistry,
   GovernedToolOrchestrator, ToolReceipt, evidence, persistence, validation, and completion owners;
2. reuse/adapt Cline/OpenCode mechanics instead of recreating equivalent generic systems;
3. introduce only a bounded adapter/projection seam required to connect those mechanics to LBE;
4. preserve agent-owned reasoning and use the bridge for typed transport, identity, ordering,
   cancellation, timeout, and integrity only;
5. disable or omit direct external filesystem, shell, process, editor, patch, provider, MCP, plugin,
   session, or completion authority outside LBE;
6. prove deny-before-execute, allow-exactly-once, receipt/evidence correlation, continuation,
   cancellation, malformed-protocol failure, identity isolation, and no duplicate authority;
7. prove the installed Rust client flow separately from source-level or Python LBE acceptance.

An equivalent feature must not be recreated without a documented incompatibility or an explicit
LBE-specific governance/provenance requirement.

## Canonical MCP/LBE acceptance gate — 2026-08-31

This is the single acceptance contract for the MCP-to-LBE execution path. It
supersedes scattered MCP/TUI checklist wording, but does not turn documentation
or source inspection into runtime proof. Each row requires claim-matched
evidence from the live implementation, persisted event/receipt records, and the
installed Rust/TUI path where applicable.

### Required proof

| # | Acceptance requirement | Required proof boundary |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Registered MCP server appears in the TUI | A live registered-server projection is rendered by the installed Rust/TUI client; source-only registration is insufficient. |
| 2 | Unregistered MCP capability is rejected | A live proposal for a capability absent from the LBE registry is rejected before any adapter/handler call. |
| 3 | Provider cannot select an arbitrary endpoint, command, or shell | Provider input is constrained to LBE-issued registered capability metadata; arbitrary endpoint/command/shell fields are rejected or ignored without execution. |
| 4 | MCP tool proposal reaches LBE | A provider/MCP proposal is observed at the LBE boundary with session, operation, tool, and identity correlation. |
| 5 | Authorization occurs before execution | Persisted or instrumented event ordering proves authorization precedes adapter/handler start. |
| 6 | Denied MCP tool executes zero times | A denied proposal produces an LBE denial receipt/result and the governed handler execution count is exactly zero. |
| 7 | Allowed MCP tool executes exactly once | An allowed proposal produces exactly one governed handler execution, with duplicate/retry protection demonstrated. |
| 8 | Receipt and evidence IDs correlate | The returned `ToolReceipt` and evidence references share a verifiable operation/session correlation and resolve to persisted records. |
| 9 | Provider continuation receives the governed result | The same provider continuation receives the LBE-generated tool result/receipt; no provider-side bypass or fabricated result is accepted. |
| 10 | All events appear in the persisted LBE session stream | Proposal, authorization, execution, result, receipt, evidence, continuation, and terminal events are persisted and replayable in the same session stream. |
| 11 | Rust displays those events without creating local authority | The installed Rust/TUI client renders authoritative LBE projections and does not become a second registry, authorization, execution, receipt, evidence, or completion owner. |
| 12 | Malformed or identity-mismatched MCP events fail closed | Invalid schema/version, missing correlation, wrong session/tool/operation identity, or malformed result events are rejected without execution or continuation reinterpretation. |

### Evidence classification rules

Use exactly one classification per row:

```text
PROVEN PASS  = live/runtime evidence satisfies the complete row
PROVEN FAIL  = live/runtime evidence demonstrates the required behavior is violated
PARTIAL      = some required behavior is proven, but the complete row is not
BLOCKED      = the required proof path cannot run because of an external or operational blocker
UNVERIFIED   = no claim-matched proof was observed
```

Do not infer `PROVEN PASS` from documentation, an implementation shape, a unit
test that does not exercise the row, or a different runtime/client. A passing
LBE/Python owner test does not prove installed Rust/TUI integration.

### Current evidence matrix

| # | Requirement | Current classification | Current evidence / limitation |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Registered MCP server appears in TUI | **UNVERIFIED** | Rust MCP projection is explicitly documented as pending; no installed live TUI observation was captured. |
| 2 | Unregistered capability rejected | **PARTIAL** | LBE external-capability checkpoint records unregistered requests fail closed; no live installed Rust/MCP proposal test was captured. |
| 3 | No arbitrary endpoint/command/shell selection | **PARTIAL** | LBE checkpoint records provider-controlled raw endpoint/URL/transport/executable/argv/command/shell selection rejected; installed end-to-end proof is absent. |
| 4 | MCP proposal reaches LBE | **PARTIAL** | Provider-continuation architecture and external registration records describe the route; a claim-matched live MCP-to-LBE trace is absent. |
| 5 | Authorization before execution | **PARTIAL** | Existing LBE owner tests/checkpoints record pre-execution authorization; full MCP/TUI event ordering is not proven. |
| 6 | Denied tool executes zero times | **PARTIAL** | Cline continuation checkpoint records denied handler execution count `0`; MCP-specific and installed Rust evidence are absent. |
| 7 | Allowed tool executes exactly once | **PARTIAL** | Existing governed continuation evidence records one governed execution for the tested path; MCP-specific and installed Rust evidence are absent. |
| 8 | Receipt/evidence correlation | **PARTIAL** | Existing LBE contracts require correlated receipt/evidence identity; a complete MCP event/receipt/evidence record was not observed. |
| 9 | Provider receives governed result | **PARTIAL** | Cline provider-continuation checkpoint records receipt-backed continuation; MCP-specific live result delivery is not proven. |
| 10 | Events persisted in LBE session stream | **UNVERIFIED** | Existing event/session owners exist, but no complete MCP proposal-through-terminal stream was captured. |
| 11 | Rust displays events without local authority | **UNVERIFIED** | Rust client integration remains pending; no installed event projection acceptance was run. |
| 12 | Malformed/identity-mismatched events fail closed | **PARTIAL** | Existing contracts/tests cover malformed and identity mismatch classes in adjacent paths; the complete MCP event path is not proven. |

### Operational reconciliation status

```text
MCP/LBE 12-point acceptance gate = OPEN
installed Rust/TUI MCP integration = NOT PROVEN

## 2026-08-31 live Rust client checkpoint

The active Rust client has now crossed the real Agent Wall in an isolated
read-only session. The following wrapper paths passed with correlated LBE
receipts/evidence: `workspace.read`, `workspace.list`, `workspace.glob`, and
`workspace.search`; the governed `workspace.patch` path was exercised under
read-only denial, with zero mutation authorization. Missing-configuration and
reconnect fail-closed checks passed, and a real PTY launch rendered
`CONNECTED · AGENT WALL` before clean `q` exit and terminal restoration.

This is evidence for the current slice, not closure. Approval-enabled mutation,
interactive receipt/diff/evidence rendering, MCP/control projection, and full
installed P2/P3 acceptance remain required. The gate therefore remains `OPEN`.
BirdEye full registry scan = IN PROGRESS
BirdEye second unchanged scan/SHA reuse = NOT RUN
publication/release = LOCKED / NOT AUTHORIZED
```

The current BirdEye trace is operational evidence for indexing progress only;
it is not evidence for MCP/LBE execution acceptance. Likewise, repository
`HEAD == upstream` proves branch-tip alignment, not a clean worktree or that
current local modifications were committed and pushed.

### Skills limitation

The curated MCP skill index was available, but its fetch endpoint returned a
path-resolution error for `mcp/mcp-builder/SKILL.md`. The skill contents were
not loaded and must not be treated as evidence for this gate. This assessment
is based on live LBE/BirdEye/TUI workspace source, persisted runtime evidence,
and project acceptance documents.
